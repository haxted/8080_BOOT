# 8080_BOOT
<think>
Okay, the user wants a small bootloader in assembly language. Let me start by recalling what a bootloader does. It's responsible for initializing the OS kernel, loading into memory, and then starting the OS. In 8086 assembly, we need to handle interrupts, so I should mention that.

First, I need to set up the memory. The 8086 has a 16-bit architecture, so I'll use registers 8000h to 80FFh. For booting, maybe load the OS from RAM. Then, set up the interrupt vector. The 8086 has interrupts from 0x80 to 0x8F, so the OS vector is 0x80. Wait, the 8086's vector is 0x80, so setting it to 0x80 should be correct.

Next, I need to handle the boot cycle. That's where the code is executed. The user probably wants to start from a simple OS. Maybe a simple example, like the 8080 microcontroller. I'll write code that starts the OS kernel, loads it into memory, then sets up the interrupt vector. Also, include some code for checking the OS state, like a simple counter.

Wait, I should also mention the 8086's registers and make sure the code is correct. Oh, the user specified 8086, so I'll use that. Let me structure the code properly: setup memory, set up the OS, handle interrupts, and output the boot status. Make sure to include the necessary lines for each step. Also, check for possible errors, like proper register access, and confirm that the code runs correctly.

Here's a small **8086 assembly bootloader** in your preferred language (8086 assembly). This example runs as a **8080-based OS**, simulating a basic boot loop.

### **8086 Bootloader (8080 Microcontroller)**

```assembly
; 8086 Assembly - 8080 Microcontroller Bootloader

; Initialize Memory (8000h - 80FFh)
MOV [8000h], 8000h
MOV [8001h], 8001h

; Set Vector Address to OS Start (0x80)
MOV [8000h], 0x80

; Enter OS Init
MOV [8000h], 0x80

; OS Kernel Initialization
MOV [8000h], 0x80
MOV [8001h], 0x80
MOV [8002h], 0x80
MOV [8003h], 0x80
MOV [8004h], 0x80
MOV [8005h], 0x80
MOV [8006h], 0x80
MOV [8007h], 0x80

; Output Boot Status
MOV [8000h], 0x00
MOV [8001h], 0x00
MOV [8002h], 0x00
MOV [8003h], 0x00
MOV [8004h], 0x00
MOV [8005h], 0x00
MOV [8006h], 0x00
MOV [8007h], 0x00

; Exit Bootloader
MOV [8000h], 0x00
MOV [8001h], 0x00
MOV [8002h], 0x00
MOV [8003h], 0x00
MOV [8004h], 0x00
MOV [8005h], 0x00
MOV [8006h], 0x00
MOV [8007h], 0x00
```

### **Usage Notes**

- This code runs in a **8080 environment**, so ensure your system supports it.
- It simulates the 8080 OS boot cycle.
- Output: 0x00 to 0x0F indicates OS success.
- You can expand it to include OS core code (e.g., kernel entry, memory management) for a full OS.

Let me know if you're working with a different architecture (e.g., 8088, 8086, or more advanced) â€“ I can tailor it further!
